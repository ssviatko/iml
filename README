This repository contains my experimentation with interpreted machine language.

I am slowly collecting 15+ years of software and data into this repo, so expect
it to grow as time goes by.

Programs contained herein:

--- Client program: the console ---

console - This is the IML console. It contains the video (and eventually audio)
frontend and memory/IO structure for any fictitious microprocessor that would
like to use it.

command switches for console:

-s (size scale): embiggens the console window by a factor of size scale.
Default is 2.

-e (server): automatically loads up and fork/execs any of the programs listed
below. This is a timesaver so you don't have to open the server in a different
window.

example: ./console -s3 -e./randvideo

--- Server programs ---

65816 - This is my 65816 emulator. It loads up a ROM file called "e4.o" at
$00/E400 and this contains a mock ROM and all the ROM vectors up to $00/FFFF.
It initiates a reset cycle, which temporarily just prints a ROM splash message
and then executes a STP instruction, halting the processor.

randvideo - This cycles through the console's video modes and throws random
information up on the screen, cycling every second.

kbdecho - Demonstrates keyboard echo using the built in CON feature of the
IO layer.
